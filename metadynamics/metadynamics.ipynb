    "The files [nacl.gro](input/nacl.gro) and [nacl.top](input/nacl.top) represent a sodium and chloride ion (one of each)  solvated in a box of water. Using the information above and the [documentation](https://biosimspace.org), set up and run a metadynamics simulation to estimate the free energy as a function of the distance between the two ions (which can be used to compute the dissociation barrier.)\n",

    "\n",
    "- Search the system for the ions by name (using `atomname`) and get their indices.\n",
    "- You'll need to create a `BSS.Metadynamics.CollectiveVariable.Distance` object to define the collective variable. Since we don't want to waste valuable computational resources sampling large distances where the ions aren't interacting, use `BSS.Metadynamics.Bound` to create an upper bound at a distance of 0.6 nm. Set a force constant of 2000.\n",
    "- It is useful to adjust the width of the Gaussian hills used to sample the free energy landscape so that you can resolve features of interest. For this simulation, choose a hill width of 0.02 nm.\n",
    "- Metadynamics simulations can be run on a _grid_ to help reduce the computational cost as the simulation progresses. (From accumulating the bias potential.) Define a grid between 0 and 1 nm to use for this simulation.\n",
    "- You can run _well-tempered_ metadynamics by setting a bias factor in the protocol. Here the height of the Gaussian hills are adaptively decreased over time such that the bias converges in the long-time limit. The bias factor should be chosen to be larger than the highest barrier you expect in the system (in units of $k_\\mathrm{B}T$). In this system the largest barrier is expected to be around $5k_\\mathrm{B}T$, so a bias factor of 5 should work well.\n",
    "- On the notebook server we have restricted GROMACS to one MPI thread and two OpenMP threads per MPI thread. Depending on how many attendees there are, we might be able to use more resources per user to make your simulations go faster. To increase the number of OpenMP threads you can do something like the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Initialise a metadynamics process but don't start it.\n",
    "process = BSS.Metadynamics.run(system, protocol, auto_start=False)\n",

    "process.setArg(\"-ntomp\", 4)\n",
    "# Start the process.\n",
    "process.start()\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "(Note that you can't set the number of OpenMP threads for a vacuum simulation, you can only partition space when there is a periodic box. Please don't use a very large number of threads or you will slow the server down for other users.)\n",
